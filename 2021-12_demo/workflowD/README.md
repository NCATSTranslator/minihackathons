# Workflow D: Explain
This workflow is designed to demonstrate the Translator's abilitiy 
to explain a biological phenomenon or observation by filling in
missing pieces between two connected concepts. There are three initial
queries here that attempt to answer the following questions:

1. Why do Crohn disease patients have a higher risk to develop
Parkinsonâ€™s disease?
2. Why do SSRI (a group of anti-depressants) have cardio-protective
effect?
3. Why are serum kynurenine and tryptophan in COVID-19 patients
anti-correlated?
4. A patient has very high ferritin levels and a biotech contact says
that metformin should lower ferritin. Can we determine why?

These queries were reverse-engineered from the neighborhood explorer
tool that gives GUI access to (SPOKE)[https://spoke.rbvi.ucsf.edu/], and
may need to be broken down into step-wise queries for a realistic
Translator workflow.

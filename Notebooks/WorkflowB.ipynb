    "# Workflow B: DILI Drug Repurposing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "DILI (drug-induced liver injury) is the outcome of a drug exposure in rare patients with heightened sensitivity to drug-related hepatic sequela. Drugs account for 20-40% of all instances of fulminant hepatic failure, and drug-induced hepatic injury is the most common cited reason for withdrawal of an approved drug from the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the etiology of DILI is not completely understood, it is believed to be the result of an immune response gone awry.\n",
    "\n",
    "DILI has only one consensus treatment: discontinuation of the causal agent. While DILI may resolve after the causal agent is discontinued, complete resolution may require months or years and, in many cases, the condition deterioriates before resolving and/or becomes chronic. Moreover, DILI is associated with high healthcare costs and high morbidity and mortality, often leading to hospitalization, liver transplant, and other poor outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aim**\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent of Workflow B is to suggest drugs for repurposing in the treatment of DILI, along with evidence of biological plausibility to justify the suggestion. The goal here is to suggest candidates for clinical trials. Indeed, this is of great interest to the international DILI Network Steering Committee, which is arguably the leading authority on DILI and the only body with a continuous 20-year registry of patients with DILI.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In natural language, one might ask *are there drugs that can be repurposed to treat DILI-associated phenotypes or outcomes, or allow a patient to continue on a drug that is otherwise effective?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Broader Impact**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to identifying plausible drugs for testing in DILIN clinical trials, the workflow and demo are intended to: \n",
    "1. Showcase the Translator clinical KPs, all of which provide open access to clinical data and/or computational models applied to those data.\n",
    "2. Provide real-world evidence that might assist with ranking/sorting of answers and/or SME evaluation of results from the third hop.\n",
    "3. Highlight Translator's technical capabilities, in terms of (a) three-hop queries, (b) batch queries, (c) asynchronous queries, and (d) open clinical data.\n",
    "* *Note that competitor commercial systems such as Causaly do not support these capabilities, thus setting the open-source Translator system apart from similar knowledge graph–based biomedical question-answering systems.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generalizability**\n",
    "\n",
    "While this workflow narrative focuses on DILI, the workflow itself is intended to be disease-agnostic. The focus on DILI is only to highlight Translator capabilities in the context of a compelling use case and engaged user community.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is structured as an initial three-hop TRAPI query that runs from input DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature CURIE (e.g., DILI `MONDO:0005359` and Toxic liver disease `SNOMEDCT:197354009`) to DiseaseOrPhenotypicFeature to Gene to Drug (including approved drugs). A fourth hop then seeks Translator evidence (clinical and non-clinical KPs) on whether any of the suggested approved drugs are used to treat or are associated with (biolink:treats, biolink:has_real_world_evidence_of_association_with) the diseases or phenotypic features identified from the first hop or other potentially related traits/diseases. The fourth hop also seeks information on whether the candidates are in clinical trials for DILI or any other disease and/or whether they are associated with adverse events. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "For implementation, the first three-hop TRAPI query will be precomputed, results will be reviewed with Paul Watkins (SME and member of the DILI Network Steering Committee), and one or two drugs will be selected to highlight in the demo. The fourth hop will then be run live at the December demo. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Curies**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggested input CURIES for the initial B.1 three-hop TRAPI queries include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* DILI - MONDO:0005359\n",
    "* Toxic liver disease - SNOMEDCT:197354009\n",
